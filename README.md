# SpinupWP Plugin

SpinupWP is a modern server control panel that's here to help you implement best practices for every server you spin up. Designed for WordPress.

This plugin adds page cache purging functionality to your WordPress site. In addition to automatically clearing the page cache for individual posts, pages, and other content when it is updated, this plugin allows you to purge the cache for the whole site as well. It also enables a persistent object cache within WordPress, which will greatly reduce the number of database calls for each page request.
